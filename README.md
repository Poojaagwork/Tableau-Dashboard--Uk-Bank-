Challenges in the Tableau for dataset 
-There is no globe icon in any of the fields when the data is uploaded in tableau. So it is difficult to make a map. 
-The above issue is sloved in tableau by selecting region and by assinging it geographic role as State 


Map: Most of the customers are in England then Scotland followed by Wales and lastly Northern Ireland.

Breakdown by balance:  It is dropping off gradually, at first slowly then quickly. The lower the the balanced band the more customers will have in that band. It is quite visible that 45% of the bank's cutomers are under $30k. 

Distribution by Age: most of the customers are their in their 30's which is around 40% of total customers.

How each region is different from the overall average ?
